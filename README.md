# STRENGTH: A Graph Theory-Based Attack Analysis Approach for Security and Robustness Assessment of Smart Home Systems

False data injection (FDI) in smart home sensor measurements can increase energy costs and compromise inhabitants' health status. Machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection models (ADMs) are being adopted to efficiently detect attacks in smart home control systems. However, an adversary with substantial system knowledge and computational power can identify backdoors from control models and ADMs to carry out stealthy FDI attacks. Nevertheless, the existing research cannot identify stealthy attack vectors from ML-based non-linear ADMs. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack analyzers leverage formal attack synthesis, which linearizes ML-based ADMs to extract attack vectors. The linearization effort diminishes significant details of the actual ADMs, preventing the identification of a range of critical attack vectors. Moreover, the SOTA framework adopts a window-based optimization approach, producing suboptimal solutions that often fail to provide any solution. We propose a novel graph theory-based attack analyzer, STRENGTH, which can identify optimal stealthy attack vectors from a non-linear ADM-supported smart home control system, overcoming the limitations of SOTA attack analyzers. We validate our attack analyzer using two real-world smart home datasets - ARAS and CASAS.
